# DM Chat

A small chat application that has certain privacy guarantees. No messages are
stored. Assuming a key can be transported securely, all messages between
individuals (or groups of individuals) are encrypted and only readable by the
intended recipients.

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
